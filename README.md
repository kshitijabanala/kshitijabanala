## Hi I'm Kshitija Banala

I’m currently working on building my GitHub profile with data science projects. 
I’m currently learning advanced data science skills (deep learning, data integration) along with various computational stiatsics methods (Bayesian Inference, Monte Carlo methods). 
I’m looking for help with front end applications, ideally displaying the data-science results on a website. 

Connect with me!
